## How it works:

- Built using [Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) to turn the script into a simple macOS app.
- Opens terminal, changes to the library cache directory, and removes all cache safe to remove.
- Afterwards, user is prompted to restart their system for the changes to take effect.
